What is DevOps?
DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). 
It aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality. 
DevOps is complementary with Agile software development; several DevOps aspects came from Agile methodology.

What are the benefits of DevOps?
The main benefits of DevOps include:
Faster delivery of features
More stable operating environments
Improved communication and collaboration
More time to innovate (rather than fix/maintain)
Reduced deployment failures and rollbacks
Shorter mean time to recovery
===================================================================================================================
What is Continuous Integration (CI) ?

Continuous Integration (CI)is a development practice where developers integrate code into a shared repository frequently, preferably several times a day. Each integration can then be verified by an automated build and automated tests.

Key aspects of CI include:

Maintaining a single source repository
Automating the build
Making the build self-testing
Everyone commits to the baseline every day
Every commit builds on an integration machine
Keep the build fast
Test in a clone of the production environment
Make it easy to get the latest deliverables
Everyone can see the results of the latest build
Automate deployments

What is Docker?
Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers. Containers allow developers to package up an application with all the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package.
